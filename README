This is still very much a work in progress, but it's ready enough to
play with. The API may settle a bit, but this is pretty much what v1.0
should look like.

Much more documentation and some example code to come.

For reference, if you want to generate the docs just run:

	ant

If you're working on your own code using coggame, drop the jar in your operating system's java extensions folder or put the coggame jar in your source directory and compile like so:

	javac -classpath coggame.jar YourClass.java

To run it, use the following:

	java -classpath coggame.jar:. YourClass

-Rodge
